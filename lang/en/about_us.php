    At that time, although the Myanmar Wrestling Federation was officially formed by the Ministry of Sports with a President, Vice-President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Executive Committee members, there were no wrestlers. In mid-2011, under the guidance of the Ministry of Sports, the Horizon Sports Academy, established by Horizon International School in Yangon, took responsibility for reactivating the Myanmar Wrestling Federation.
    For the 27th Southeast Asian Games, which Myanmar hosted in 2013, three coaches from Turkey were engaged, and both male and female teams were sent for joint training in Turkey and Thailand to ensure a successful medal haul. With this training, Myanmar wrestlers competed in the 27th SEA Games and won 3 gold, 3 silver, and 6 bronze medals, elevating the country`s prestige.
    From 2011 to the present, during a period of five years, the sport of wrestling has participated in international competitions. In 2015, a major Asian wrestling competition was successfully organized at Wunna Theikdi Stadium Office (5) in Nay Pyi Taw. The Myanmar Wrestling Federation is continuing to plan and work towards producing new generations of wrestlers in the future.
